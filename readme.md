This is a *very* basic start for a role-playing battle engine.  To call it anything more than a rough proof of concept/playground idea would be overkill.

Really, this was some code I had lying around from a few years ago when I spent an evening toying with some ideas to write an RPG game.

Use it for whatever you might think it's worth.

There are three classes: Mage, Marksman, and Warrior.   

Attributes:

    * strength
	* agility
	* intelligence
	* initiative
	* defense
	* armor
	
	
Each class has a modifier (+/-) to various attributes. For example, a Warrior might get +2 to Strength and +2 to armor.
